🔌 Why a Hybrid Architecture (Node + Python + React + C++)?
✔ React
Best UI for real-time dashboards.

✔ Node.js
Handles massive I/O, ideal for 100+ APIs, websockets, brokers.

✔ Python
Industry standard for ML/DL/RL/GenAI and quant research.

✔ C++ (optional)
Provides HFT-level performance when needed.

This combination gives you a future-proof quant stack.

🧬 Strategy Engine Design

Strategies live in:

ai_core/strategy_engine/

Types of Strategies:
Type	Description
Rule-Based	SMA, RSI, MACD, structure-based
ML-Based	LSTM/Transformer prediction models
RL-Based	PPO, SAC, DQN trained agents
Hybrid	AI + statistical + GenAI reasoning
Sentiment/NLP	News, FinBERT, GPT-based classification
GenAI Agent	LLM-driven strategy planning

Each strategy outputs:

{
  strategy_id: "AI-3",
  confidence: 0.63,
  direction: "SELL",
  symbol: "EURUSD",
  timestamp: ...
}


These power your Strategy Cards in the dashboard.

📡 100+ API Plugin System

All integrations live in:
node_gateway/src/integrations/


Each API:
Has its own folder
Has its own connector
Has its own normalizer
Publishes standardized events

Adding a new API =
Just add a new folder — no code rewrite required.

🧩 Why This Architecture Is Future-Proof

Supports future upgrades:
New AI models
New data APIs
New brokers
Quantum ML modules
Multi-agent LLM frameworks (MCP/LangGraph)
On-chain trading
Mobile dashboards
Automated retraining pipeline
Cluster scaling

You never need to rewrite the system again — just extend it.

🔥 Why This Is Ideal for a Solo Quant

Backend team
AI team
Frontend team
DevOps team
Data engineering team
Quant R&D team

Because the system is:
Modular
